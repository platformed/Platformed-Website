                Platformed is a free game to make and play levels.
                Design mode allows you to create levels out of blocks, test them, and upload them for other people to play.
                With play mode, you can play other people's uploaded levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our team is made up of two people, and the game is being developed with the unity game engine.
                We would like to hear what you think about our game over at our <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>.
